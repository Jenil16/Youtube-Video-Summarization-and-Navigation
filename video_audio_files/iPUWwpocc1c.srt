1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,806
Ever wondered about the differences between AI, ML, DL and

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,854
ds? Well, we're about to explore all of those today.

3
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:10,214
Stay tuned. So let's dive right into it. So AI versus

4
00:00:10,294 --> 00:00:13,590
ML versus DL versus DS, a whole bunch of jargon,

5
00:00:13,622 --> 00:00:16,926
but we're going to clarify all of that right up. So let's kick

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,878
things off and take a look at AI. So AI

7
00:00:20,926 --> 00:00:25,206
is really to do with the ability of computers and machines to perform tasks

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,616
without explicitly programming them, otherwise known as

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,044
the ability for computers and machines to think by themselves.

10
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:35,456
So we typically break out AI into two key categories.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,504
These are general AI and narrow AI. General AI

12
00:00:39,544 --> 00:00:42,832
typically refers to the ability for a computer or a machine to be

13
00:00:42,848 --> 00:00:46,752
able to handle a wide variety of tasks. Us as humans have

14
00:00:46,768 --> 00:00:50,120
the ability to do a whole heap of stuff. We can see, we can speak,

15
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:53,376
we can hear, we can read, we can drive, we can do a whole range

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,862
of things. The ability for AI and machines to be able to

17
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:00,718
do a broad range of tasks similar to humans is what we typically refer

18
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:04,614
to as general AI. Now, we're still a little bit of a while

19
00:01:04,654 --> 00:01:08,030
away from true general AI, but that's not to say it's not to

20
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:11,630
come. Now, narrow AI, on the other hand, is the ability

21
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:15,078
for a machine to handle a really simple or a really narrow

22
00:01:15,126 --> 00:01:18,710
range of tasks. So that could possibly be the ability to translate speech to

23
00:01:18,742 --> 00:01:21,982
text, or to classify images as having different categories,

24
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:25,530
or the ability to predict house prices, for example, or all of

25
00:01:25,562 --> 00:01:29,306
these are examples of narrow AI. So I'm going to be painting a

26
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,506
bunch of visual imagery to help you remember some of these topics. So the first

27
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:36,186
one, in terms of breaking out general and narrow AI, or the ability to

28
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,034
remember general and narrow AI, is just picture a really narrow

29
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:43,418
or really skinny general in your mind. So that way you know that there's two

30
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:47,266
different types of AI, general and narrow. Now onto the next topic,

31
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,522
machine learning. So we've taken a look at AI as being broken up into general

32
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:53,838
and narrow. But how does machine learning fit into this? Well,

33
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:58,198
machine learning is the application of narrow AI to specific tasks.

34
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:02,478
Now, when we typically talk about machine learning, we often compare it to traditional programming.

35
00:02:02,526 --> 00:02:05,990
So in traditional programming, we supply data plus rules or

36
00:02:06,022 --> 00:02:09,358
conditional logic, and we get answers. Now, in machine learning,

37
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:13,166
on the other hand, we provide data plus historical answers to

38
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,726
get rules. We can then pass new data to get new answers. So this

39
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,926
is a bit of a change in the paradigm of how computer scientists and

40
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,662
machine learning engineers are building programs these days. So what are

41
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:27,278
some typical machine learning tasks? Well, we broadly break

42
00:02:27,326 --> 00:02:30,774
out machine learning into three key categories. These are

43
00:02:30,814 --> 00:02:34,214
supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and semi supervised

44
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,790
learning. So let's take a look at supervised learning first. So, supervised learning

45
00:02:37,822 --> 00:02:41,270
can be broadly broken out into two key categories. These are

46
00:02:41,302 --> 00:02:44,550
classification and regression. Classification is all

47
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:48,022
to do with grouping things into categories or labels.

48
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:51,398
So say you had a big data set on all the different types of pizzas

49
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:55,050
you've liked and whether or not you've liked them. Yes or no. You could take

50
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:58,410
that data and pass it through to a classification algorithm to

51
00:02:58,442 --> 00:03:01,586
help it learn which types of pizzas you like. So then when you pass through

52
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,506
a new list of ingredients, it would be able to predict, yes,

53
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,362
you would like that pizza or no, you might not. Regression, on the other

54
00:03:08,418 --> 00:03:11,274
hand, is all to do with predicting continuous variables.

55
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:14,898
Some great examples of regression are sales forecasting and predicting

56
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:19,018
prices of houses. So that encapsulates supervised learning. Now, what about unsupervised

57
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:23,628
learning? Well, there's two key things to think about when you think of unsupervised

58
00:03:23,676 --> 00:03:27,420
learning. These are really clustering. So the ability to group people together.

59
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:31,388
So say you wanted to group together high performing and low performing and medium

60
00:03:31,436 --> 00:03:35,540
performing employees, or high value, low value, medium value customers,

61
00:03:35,612 --> 00:03:38,812
or a whole bunch of other different types of data. But really it's all to

62
00:03:38,828 --> 00:03:42,092
do with grouping things together. Now, dimensionality reduction, on the

63
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:45,796
other hand, is all to do with condensing the features that

64
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,958
you've got within a machine learning model. So a lot of the time you might

65
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:52,382
start out with a huge data set with a lot of columns, and you're not

66
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,622
really sure which of those columns are important for your machine learning model.

67
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:59,390
Dimensionality reduction helps you reduce the number of columns that

68
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:02,702
you've got so that you can really focus on the important ones.

69
00:04:02,838 --> 00:04:06,998
Now, in order to remember supervised learning and unsupervised learning,

70
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:10,726
I'd suggest you remember this initialism, Christopher Robin caught

71
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,030
a duck. So that way you remember classification, regression,

72
00:04:14,102 --> 00:04:18,067
clustering and dimensionality reduction. So that takes care of supervised

73
00:04:18,115 --> 00:04:21,467
and unsupervised learning. But what about semi supervised learning? Well,

74
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:25,779
this is where reinforcement learning comes in. Now, reinforcement learning has four

75
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:28,947
key things. These are an agent, an action,

76
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:33,107
an environment, and a reward. It's similar to how you might choose to

77
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:36,651
condition a dog. A dog might do something right and you might reward it

78
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:40,491
with a piece of food. In a similar way, we train reinforcement

79
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:44,610
learning models to act in a correct way in a given environment in order

80
00:04:44,642 --> 00:04:48,034
to learn appropriate actions given that specific environment.

81
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:52,082
Now, the best way to remember reinforcement learning techniques is to remember

82
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:56,106
area 51. So that way you remember agent reward environment

83
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,378
and actions. Okay? So that takes care of machine learning.

84
00:04:59,426 --> 00:05:02,514
Now we're going to delve a little bit deeper and get into deep learning.

85
00:05:02,674 --> 00:05:06,354
So deep learning is a subset of machine learning, and really it's to do

86
00:05:06,394 --> 00:05:09,906
with performing machine learning tasks using deep neural

87
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,060
networks. Now, deep neural networks are networks that

88
00:05:13,092 --> 00:05:17,036
have multiple hidden layers. So if you've ever seen a diagram that looks

89
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,636
sort of like this, this is a representation of a neural

90
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,444
network. But specifically in this case, this is a deep neural network

91
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:28,548
because it has multiple hidden layers. Now, the best way to remember deep

92
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:32,180
learning is to remember that deep learning is just like an onion. It has

93
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:35,372
multiple layers, a little bit like Shrek. Now, that sort of

94
00:05:35,388 --> 00:05:38,720
covers AI, ML and DL. What about data science?

95
00:05:38,832 --> 00:05:42,072
Well, data science is the practice that sits over

96
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:45,752
AI, ML and DL. It basically is the art

97
00:05:45,808 --> 00:05:49,240
of extracting knowledge, insight and meaning from data.

98
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:52,800
The best way to remember the key components of data science are to look at

99
00:05:52,832 --> 00:05:56,272
the CrispDM framework. So the CrisPDM framework

100
00:05:56,328 --> 00:06:00,112
stands for the cross industry standard process for data mining. And basically

101
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:03,536
it's a framework to help you along your way to producing really

102
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,902
good data science projects. Now, there's six key steps

103
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:10,390
in the data science process. These are business understanding.

104
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:13,950
So understanding the business that you're working with and the environment in which they

105
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:17,670
operate. Two data understanding. So understanding the

106
00:06:17,702 --> 00:06:21,230
data that you've got on hand. So whether or not you've got missing values,

107
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:24,718
visualizing that data and taking a look at some summary statistics,

108
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:28,086
we've then got data preparation. So this is all to do with getting

109
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,526
our data ready for modeling. In this step, we might perform some feature

110
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,302
engineering and create some new columns. We might fill in some missing values and,

111
00:06:35,318 --> 00:06:38,902
and a whole bunch of other data preparation steps, like, for example,

112
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:41,942
splitting our data into training and testing. Next,

113
00:06:41,998 --> 00:06:45,494
we've got my favorite, which is modeling. This is all to do with training your

114
00:06:45,534 --> 00:06:48,758
machine learning algorithms to perform well on a specific

115
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:51,990
task. Once we've trained our models in that modeling step,

116
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:55,270
we get onto evaluation. Given that we've trained our model,

117
00:06:55,302 --> 00:06:58,126
we want to make sure that it's going to work well once we deploy it

118
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,836
into the real world. This is what the evaluation step is all about.

119
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,072
In this step, we try to check whether or not our model is likely to

120
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:08,616
perform well using specific evaluation metrics. Now, once we've

121
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,000
gone through all of that, the last step is to go and deploy our

122
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:15,520
model. In order to deploy our model, we could release it as a rest API,

123
00:07:15,592 --> 00:07:19,208
containerize it up or save it as a binary so we can go and

124
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:23,216
use it elsewhere. Now, a great way to remember CrispDM is to remember

125
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,136
Barry drove directly to the medical emergency department. That way

126
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,936
you remember business understanding data, understanding data preparation,

127
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,838
modeling, evaluation, and deployment. Now, I've talked a lot about theory,

128
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:38,494
but where do the python packages that you typically see used fit into

129
00:07:38,534 --> 00:07:41,758
this framework? Well, in terms of data science, numpy,

130
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:45,326
pandas and Matplotlib are probably going to be the most important packages that

131
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,310
you see floating around. Numpy and pandas help you traverse

132
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:53,838
and explore your data and really work with your data. In terms of performing manipulations

133
00:07:53,926 --> 00:07:57,950
and data preparation, Matplotlib and Seaborn help you visualize that

134
00:07:57,982 --> 00:08:01,384
data and explore it even further. Now, the most important library

135
00:08:01,424 --> 00:08:04,952
in terms of machine learning is probably scikit learn. So scikit learn has

136
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:08,912
been around for quite some time and gives you a whole bunch of

137
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:12,624
really powerful algorithms and utilities to help use them to train

138
00:08:12,664 --> 00:08:16,360
your machine learning models. Now, deep learning is becoming increasingly

139
00:08:16,392 --> 00:08:19,584
popular, and there's a large number of libraries that can help you

140
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:23,352
perform deep learning, some of which, which are notable, are tensorflow,

141
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:26,908
Keras, Pytorch, and piano, just to name a few.

142
00:08:27,036 --> 00:08:30,380
And that about wraps up AI versus ML versus DL

143
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:33,764
versus ds. Thanks so much for tuning in, guys. Hopefully you found

144
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,860
this video useful. If you did, be sure to give it a thumbs up and

1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,134
Ever wondered about the differences between AI, ML,

2
00:00:03,214 --> 00:00:06,510
DL and ds? Well, we're about to explore all of those

3
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:09,742
today. Stay tuned. So let's dive right into it. So AI

4
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:13,142
versus ML versus DL versus DS, a whole bunch

5
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:16,334
of jargon, but we're going to clarify all of that right up.

6
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:19,074
So let's kick things off and take a look at AI.

7
00:00:19,694 --> 00:00:23,390
So AI is really to do with the ability of computers

8
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:27,660
and machines to perform tasks without explicitly programming them,

9
00:00:27,782 --> 00:00:31,088
otherwise known as the ability for computers and machines to think

10
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:34,408
by themselves. So we typically break out AI into

11
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:37,784
two key categories. These are general AI and narrow

12
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:41,488
AI. General AI typically refers to the ability for

13
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:44,824
a computer or a machine to be able to handle a wide variety of

14
00:00:44,864 --> 00:00:48,568
tasks. Us as humans have the ability to do a whole heap of stuff.

15
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:52,200
We can see, we can speak, we can hear, we can read, we can drive,

16
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:55,598
we can do a whole range of things. The ability for AI

17
00:00:55,646 --> 00:00:58,974
and machines to be able to do a broad range of tasks similar to

18
00:00:59,014 --> 00:01:02,782
humans is what we typically refer to as general AI.

19
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,414
Now, we're still a little bit of a while away from true general AI,

20
00:01:06,454 --> 00:01:10,190
but that's not to say it's not to come. Now, narrow AI,

21
00:01:10,262 --> 00:01:13,446
on the other hand, is the ability for a machine to handle a really

22
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,462
simple or a really narrow range of tasks. So that could possibly be the ability

23
00:01:17,518 --> 00:01:21,398
to translate speech to text, or to classify images as having different

24
00:01:21,446 --> 00:01:24,878
categories, or the ability to predict house prices, for example,

25
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:28,386
or all of these are examples of narrow AI. So I'm going

26
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,570
to be painting a bunch of visual imagery to help you remember some of these

27
00:01:31,602 --> 00:01:34,954
topics. So the first one, in terms of breaking out general and narrow

28
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:38,002
AI, or the ability to remember general and narrow AI,

29
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:42,146
is just picture a really narrow or really skinny general in your mind. So that

30
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,930
way you know that there's two different types of AI, general and narrow.

31
00:01:46,002 --> 00:01:49,370
Now onto the next topic, machine learning. So we've taken a look at AI as

32
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:52,706
being broken up into general and narrow. But how does machine learning fit into

33
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:56,918
this? Well, machine learning is the application of narrow AI to

34
00:01:56,966 --> 00:02:00,334
specific tasks. Now, when we typically talk about machine learning,

35
00:02:00,374 --> 00:02:03,854
we often compare it to traditional programming. So in traditional programming,

36
00:02:03,894 --> 00:02:06,838
we supply data plus rules or conditional logic,

37
00:02:06,886 --> 00:02:10,174
and we get answers. Now, in machine learning, on the other hand,

38
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:14,062
we provide data plus historical answers to get rules. We can

39
00:02:14,078 --> 00:02:17,366
then pass new data to get new answers. So this is a bit of a

40
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,102
change in the paradigm of how computer scientists and machine learning engineers

41
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:24,814
are building programs these days. So what are some typical machine

42
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:29,310
learning tasks? Well, we broadly break out machine learning into three

43
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:31,950
key categories. These are supervised learning,

44
00:02:32,102 --> 00:02:35,390
unsupervised learning, and semi supervised learning. So let's take a look at

45
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:38,630
supervised learning first. So, supervised learning can be broadly

46
00:02:38,662 --> 00:02:42,118
broken out into two key categories. These are classification

47
00:02:42,206 --> 00:02:45,982
and regression. Classification is all to do with grouping

48
00:02:46,038 --> 00:02:49,198
things into categories or labels. So say you had a big data

49
00:02:49,246 --> 00:02:52,502
set on all the different types of pizzas you've liked and whether or

50
00:02:52,518 --> 00:02:56,306
not you've liked them. Yes or no. You could take that data and pass it

51
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,730
through to a classification algorithm to help it learn which types

52
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:02,778
of pizzas you like. So then when you pass through a new list of ingredients,

53
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:06,186
it would be able to predict, yes, you would like that pizza or no,

54
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,490
you might not. Regression, on the other hand, is all to do with

55
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,234
predicting continuous variables. Some great examples of regression are

56
00:03:13,274 --> 00:03:17,378
sales forecasting and predicting prices of houses. So that encapsulates supervised

57
00:03:17,426 --> 00:03:21,396
learning. Now, what about unsupervised learning? Well, there's two key things

58
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,188
to think about when you think of unsupervised learning.

59
00:03:24,316 --> 00:03:28,172
These are really clustering. So the ability to group people together. So say you

60
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:31,388
wanted to group together high performing and low performing and medium

61
00:03:31,436 --> 00:03:34,916
performing employees, or high value, low value, medium value

62
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,892
customers, or a whole bunch of other different types of data.

63
00:03:37,988 --> 00:03:41,844
But really it's all to do with grouping things together. Now, dimensionality reduction,

64
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:45,188
on the other hand, is all to do with condensing the

65
00:03:45,236 --> 00:03:48,534
features that you've got within a machine learning model. So a lot of the time

66
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:51,854
you might start out with a huge data set with a lot of columns,

67
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:55,190
and you're not really sure which of those columns are important for your machine learning

68
00:03:55,222 --> 00:03:59,142
model. Dimensionality reduction helps you reduce the number of columns

69
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:02,702
that you've got so that you can really focus on the important ones.

70
00:04:02,838 --> 00:04:06,318
Now, in order to remember supervised learning and unsupervised

71
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:09,462
learning, I'd suggest you remember this initialism,

72
00:04:09,558 --> 00:04:13,254
Christopher Robin caught a duck. So that way you remember classification,

73
00:04:13,374 --> 00:04:16,447
regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.

74
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:20,139
So that takes care of supervised and unsupervised learning. But what about semi

75
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:23,627
supervised learning? Well, this is where reinforcement learning comes

76
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:27,667
in. Now, reinforcement learning has four key things. These are an

77
00:04:27,715 --> 00:04:31,659
agent, an action, an environment, and a reward. It's similar to

78
00:04:31,691 --> 00:04:34,899
how you might choose to condition a dog. A dog might do

79
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:38,203
something right and you might reward it with a piece of food.

80
00:04:38,323 --> 00:04:41,987
In a similar way, we train reinforcement learning models to act

81
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:45,706
in a correct way in a given environment in order to learn appropriate

82
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,434
actions given that specific environment. Now, the best way to remember

83
00:04:49,514 --> 00:04:53,466
reinforcement learning techniques is to remember area 51.

84
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,138
So that way you remember agent reward environment and actions.

85
00:04:57,226 --> 00:05:00,386
Okay? So that takes care of machine learning. Now we're going to delve a little

86
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,618
bit deeper and get into deep learning. So deep learning

87
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:07,634
is a subset of machine learning, and really it's to do with performing machine

88
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,680
learning tasks using deep neural networks.

89
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:14,204
Now, deep neural networks are networks that have multiple hidden

90
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:17,564
layers. So if you've ever seen a diagram that looks sort of like

91
00:05:17,604 --> 00:05:21,188
this, this is a representation of a neural network.

92
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:24,788
But specifically in this case, this is a deep neural network because

93
00:05:24,836 --> 00:05:28,844
it has multiple hidden layers. Now, the best way to remember deep learning

94
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:32,564
is to remember that deep learning is just like an onion. It has multiple

95
00:05:32,604 --> 00:05:36,220
layers, a little bit like Shrek. Now, that sort of covers AI,

96
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:40,096
ML and DL. What about data science? Well, data science

97
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,960
is the practice that sits over AI, ML and DL.

98
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:47,448
It basically is the art of extracting knowledge,

99
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:51,368
insight and meaning from data. The best way to remember the key components of data

100
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:54,608
science are to look at the CrispDM framework.

101
00:05:54,736 --> 00:05:58,680
So the CrisPDM framework stands for the cross industry standard process

102
00:05:58,752 --> 00:06:02,280
for data mining. And basically it's a framework to help you along your

103
00:06:02,312 --> 00:06:05,454
way to producing really good data science projects. Now,

104
00:06:05,494 --> 00:06:08,582
there's six key steps in the data science process.

105
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:11,982
These are business understanding. So understanding the business that

106
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:15,862
you're working with and the environment in which they operate. Two data

107
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,710
understanding. So understanding the data that you've got on hand. So whether

108
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:22,942
or not you've got missing values, visualizing that data and taking a

109
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:26,446
look at some summary statistics, we've then got data preparation.

110
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,166
So this is all to do with getting our data ready for modeling. In this

111
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,670
step, we might perform some feature engineering and create some new columns. We might

112
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:38,038
fill in some missing values and, and a whole bunch of other data preparation steps,

113
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:41,414
like, for example, splitting our data into training and testing.

114
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:45,222
Next, we've got my favorite, which is modeling. This is all to do with training

115
00:06:45,278 --> 00:06:48,758
your machine learning algorithms to perform well on a specific

116
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:52,886
task. Once we've trained our models in that modeling step, we get onto

117
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,486
evaluation. Given that we've trained our model, we want to make sure that it's going

118
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,766
to work well once we deploy it into the real world. This is

119
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,760
what the evaluation step is all about. In this step, we try to check whether

120
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:07,936
or not our model is likely to perform well using specific evaluation metrics.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,304
Now, once we've gone through all of that, the last step is to go and

122
00:07:11,344 --> 00:07:14,496
deploy our model. In order to deploy our model, we could release it

123
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,072
as a rest API, containerize it up or save it as a binary

124
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:21,616
so we can go and use it elsewhere. Now, a great way to

125
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,368
remember CrispDM is to remember Barry drove directly to the medical

126
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:28,792
emergency department. That way you remember business understanding

127
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,664
data, understanding data preparation, modeling,

128
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:35,246
evaluation, and deployment. Now, I've talked a lot about theory, but where

129
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,494
do the python packages that you typically see used fit into

130
00:07:38,534 --> 00:07:41,758
this framework? Well, in terms of data science, numpy,

131
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:45,462
pandas and Matplotlib are probably going to be the most important packages that you

132
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:49,310
see floating around. Numpy and pandas help you traverse

133
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:53,838
and explore your data and really work with your data. In terms of performing manipulations

134
00:07:53,926 --> 00:07:57,054
and data preparation, Matplotlib and Seaborn help

135
00:07:57,094 --> 00:08:00,336
you visualize that data and explore it even further. Now,

136
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,016
the most important library in terms of machine learning is probably scikit learn.

137
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,992
So scikit learn has been around for quite some time and gives you a whole

138
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,464
bunch of really powerful algorithms and utilities to help

139
00:08:11,504 --> 00:08:15,520
use them to train your machine learning models. Now, deep learning is becoming

140
00:08:15,632 --> 00:08:19,584
increasingly popular, and there's a large number of libraries that can help you

141
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:23,352
perform deep learning, some of which, which are notable, are tensorflow,

142
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:26,908
Keras, Pytorch, and piano, just to name a few.

143
00:08:27,036 --> 00:08:30,380
And that about wraps up AI versus ML versus DL

144
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:33,764
versus ds. Thanks so much for tuning in, guys. Hopefully you found

145
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,860
this video useful. If you did, be sure to give it a thumbs up and

146
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,676
hit subscribe until next time.

1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,806
Ever wondered about the differences between AI, ML, DL and

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,542
ds? Well, we're about to explore all of those today. Stay tuned.

3
00:00:07,598 --> 00:00:11,942
So let's dive right into it. So AI versus ML versus DL versus

4
00:00:11,998 --> 00:00:15,718
DS, a whole bunch of jargon, but we're going to clarify all of that

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:19,074
right up. So let's kick things off and take a look at AI.

6
00:00:19,694 --> 00:00:23,390
So AI is really to do with the ability of computers

7
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:27,190
and machines to perform tasks without explicitly programming

8
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:30,840
them, otherwise known as the ability for computers and machines to

9
00:00:30,872 --> 00:00:34,112
think by themselves. So we typically break out AI

10
00:00:34,168 --> 00:00:38,560
into two key categories. These are general AI and narrow AI.

11
00:00:38,752 --> 00:00:42,272
General AI typically refers to the ability for a computer or a

12
00:00:42,288 --> 00:00:45,608
machine to be able to handle a wide variety of tasks.

13
00:00:45,776 --> 00:00:48,920
Us as humans have the ability to do a whole heap of stuff. We can

14
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:52,472
see, we can speak, we can hear, we can read, we can drive, we can

15
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:55,830
do a whole range of things. The ability for AI and

16
00:00:55,862 --> 00:00:59,590
machines to be able to do a broad range of tasks similar to humans is

17
00:00:59,622 --> 00:01:03,110
what we typically refer to as general AI. Now,

18
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:06,414
we're still a little bit of a while away from true general AI,

19
00:01:06,454 --> 00:01:09,238
but that's not to say it's not to come. Now,

20
00:01:09,326 --> 00:01:12,670
narrow AI, on the other hand, is the ability for a machine to

21
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:15,862
handle a really simple or a really narrow range of tasks.

22
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:19,174
So that could possibly be the ability to translate speech to text,

23
00:01:19,294 --> 00:01:22,902
or to classify images as having different categories, or the ability

24
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:27,186
to predict house prices, for example, or all of these are examples of narrow

25
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,490
AI. So I'm going to be painting a bunch of visual imagery to

26
00:01:30,522 --> 00:01:33,850
help you remember some of these topics. So the first one, in terms of breaking

27
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:38,002
out general and narrow AI, or the ability to remember general and narrow AI,

28
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:41,482
is just picture a really narrow or really skinny general in

29
00:01:41,498 --> 00:01:44,722
your mind. So that way you know that there's two different types of AI,

30
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:48,266
general and narrow. Now onto the next topic, machine learning. So we've

31
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,482
taken a look at AI as being broken up into general and narrow. But how

32
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:55,598
does machine learning fit into this? Well, machine learning is the application

33
00:01:55,646 --> 00:01:59,550
of narrow AI to specific tasks. Now, when we typically talk

34
00:01:59,582 --> 00:02:03,350
about machine learning, we often compare it to traditional programming. So in traditional

35
00:02:03,382 --> 00:02:06,838
programming, we supply data plus rules or conditional logic,

36
00:02:06,886 --> 00:02:10,174
and we get answers. Now, in machine learning, on the other hand,

37
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:13,758
we provide data plus historical answers to get rules.

38
00:02:13,806 --> 00:02:17,118
We can then pass new data to get new answers. So this is a bit

39
00:02:17,126 --> 00:02:20,590
of a change in the paradigm of how computer scientists and machine learning

40
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:24,390
engineers are building programs these days. So what are some typical

41
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:28,270
machine learning tasks? Well, we broadly break out machine learning

42
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:31,950
into three key categories. These are supervised learning,

43
00:02:32,102 --> 00:02:35,390
unsupervised learning, and semi supervised learning. So let's take a look at

44
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:39,214
supervised learning first. So, supervised learning can be broadly broken out

45
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:43,206
into two key categories. These are classification and regression.

46
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,246
Classification is all to do with grouping things into categories

47
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,558
or labels. So say you had a big data set on all the different

48
00:02:50,606 --> 00:02:54,330
types of pizzas you've liked and whether or not you've liked them. Yes or no.

49
00:02:54,462 --> 00:02:58,410
You could take that data and pass it through to a classification algorithm to

50
00:02:58,442 --> 00:03:01,586
help it learn which types of pizzas you like. So then when you pass through

51
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,106
a new list of ingredients, it would be able to predict, yes, you would like

52
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,634
that pizza or no, you might not. Regression, on the other hand,

53
00:03:08,674 --> 00:03:12,370
is all to do with predicting continuous variables. Some great examples of

54
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:15,858
regression are sales forecasting and predicting prices of houses.

55
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:19,554
So that encapsulates supervised learning. Now, what about unsupervised learning?

56
00:03:19,674 --> 00:03:23,628
Well, there's two key things to think about when you think of unsupervised

57
00:03:23,676 --> 00:03:27,420
learning. These are really clustering. So the ability to group people together.

58
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:31,044
So say you wanted to group together high performing and low performing and

59
00:03:31,084 --> 00:03:34,236
medium performing employees, or high value, low value,

60
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,892
medium value customers, or a whole bunch of other different types of data.

61
00:03:37,988 --> 00:03:40,604
But really it's all to do with grouping things together. Now,

62
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:44,844
dimensionality reduction, on the other hand, is all to do with condensing

63
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:48,198
the features that you've got within a machine learning model. So a lot of

64
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:51,326
the time you might start out with a huge data set with a lot of

65
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,542
columns, and you're not really sure which of those columns are important for

66
00:03:54,558 --> 00:03:58,326
your machine learning model. Dimensionality reduction helps you reduce the

67
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,998
number of columns that you've got so that you can really focus on the important

68
00:04:02,086 --> 00:04:06,318
ones. Now, in order to remember supervised learning and unsupervised

69
00:04:06,366 --> 00:04:09,462
learning, I'd suggest you remember this initialism,

70
00:04:09,558 --> 00:04:13,254
Christopher Robin caught a duck. So that way you remember classification,

71
00:04:13,374 --> 00:04:16,447
regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.

72
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:20,139
So that takes care of supervised and unsupervised learning. But what about semi

73
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:23,907
supervised learning? Well, this is where reinforcement learning comes in.

74
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:27,371
Now, reinforcement learning has four key things. These are

75
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:30,731
an agent, an action, an environment, and a reward.

76
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:34,019
It's similar to how you might choose to condition a dog.

77
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:37,755
A dog might do something right and you might reward it with a piece of

78
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:41,195
food. In a similar way, we train reinforcement learning models

79
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:45,106
to act in a correct way in a given environment in order to learn

80
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,466
appropriate actions given that specific environment. Now,

81
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,714
the best way to remember reinforcement learning techniques is to remember area

82
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:57,138
51. So that way you remember agent reward environment and actions.

83
00:04:57,226 --> 00:05:00,386
Okay? So that takes care of machine learning. Now we're going to delve a little

84
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,618
bit deeper and get into deep learning. So deep learning

85
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:07,634
is a subset of machine learning, and really it's to do with performing machine

86
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,680
learning tasks using deep neural networks.

87
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:14,572
Now, deep neural networks are networks that have multiple hidden layers.

88
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:17,996
So if you've ever seen a diagram that looks sort of like this,

89
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,188
this is a representation of a neural network.

90
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:24,996
But specifically in this case, this is a deep neural network because it

91
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,548
has multiple hidden layers. Now, the best way to remember deep

92
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:31,700
learning is to remember that deep learning is just like an onion.

93
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:35,708
It has multiple layers, a little bit like Shrek. Now, that sort of covers

94
00:05:35,756 --> 00:05:38,720
AI, ML and DL. What about data science?

95
00:05:38,832 --> 00:05:42,688
Well, data science is the practice that sits over AI,

96
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:46,880
ML and DL. It basically is the art of extracting

97
00:05:46,952 --> 00:05:50,144
knowledge, insight and meaning from data. The best way to remember

98
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,928
the key components of data science are to look at the CrispDM

99
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:57,792
framework. So the CrisPDM framework stands for the cross industry

100
00:05:57,888 --> 00:06:01,552
standard process for data mining. And basically it's a framework to help

101
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:05,090
you along your way to producing really good data science projects.

102
00:06:05,192 --> 00:06:08,582
Now, there's six key steps in the data science process.

103
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:12,166
These are business understanding. So understanding the business that you're

104
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,766
working with and the environment in which they operate.

105
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:18,638
Two data understanding. So understanding the data that you've got

106
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:22,334
on hand. So whether or not you've got missing values, visualizing that data

107
00:06:22,374 --> 00:06:26,446
and taking a look at some summary statistics, we've then got data preparation.

108
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,166
So this is all to do with getting our data ready for modeling. In this

109
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,670
step, we might perform some feature engineering and create some new columns. We might

110
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:37,590
fill in some missing values and, and a whole bunch of other data preparation

111
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:41,414
steps, like, for example, splitting our data into training and testing.

112
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:45,222
Next, we've got my favorite, which is modeling. This is all to do with training

113
00:06:45,278 --> 00:06:48,758
your machine learning algorithms to perform well on a specific

114
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:51,990
task. Once we've trained our models in that modeling step,

115
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:55,686
we get onto evaluation. Given that we've trained our model, we want to

116
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,718
make sure that it's going to work well once we deploy it into the real

117
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:02,296
world. This is what the evaluation step is all about. In this

118
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,672
step, we try to check whether or not our model is likely to perform well

119
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:09,136
using specific evaluation metrics. Now, once we've gone through

120
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,440
all of that, the last step is to go and deploy our model.

121
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:15,520
In order to deploy our model, we could release it as a rest API,

122
00:07:15,592 --> 00:07:19,440
containerize it up or save it as a binary so we can go and use

123
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:23,728
it elsewhere. Now, a great way to remember CrispDM is to remember Barry

124
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,592
drove directly to the medical emergency department.

125
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:30,936
That way you remember business understanding data, understanding data preparation,

126
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,286
modeling, evaluation, and deployment. Now, I've talked a lot

127
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,518
about theory, but where do the python packages that you typically see

128
00:07:37,566 --> 00:07:41,222
used fit into this framework? Well, in terms of data science,

129
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:45,102
numpy, pandas and Matplotlib are probably going to be the most important packages

130
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:49,310
that you see floating around. Numpy and pandas help you traverse

131
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:52,830
and explore your data and really work with your data. In terms of performing

132
00:07:52,862 --> 00:07:55,222
manipulations and data preparation,

133
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:58,990
Matplotlib and Seaborn help you visualize that data and explore

134
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:02,584
it even further. Now, the most important library in terms of machine learning

135
00:08:02,624 --> 00:08:06,024
is probably scikit learn. So scikit learn has been around for quite some

136
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:10,208
time and gives you a whole bunch of really powerful algorithms

137
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:13,976
and utilities to help use them to train your machine learning models.

138
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,384
Now, deep learning is becoming increasingly popular, and there's a

139
00:08:17,424 --> 00:08:20,808
large number of libraries that can help you perform deep learning,

140
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:24,040
some of which, which are notable, are tensorflow, Keras,

141
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:27,964
Pytorch, and piano, just to name a few. And that about wraps

142
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:31,396
up AI versus ML versus DL versus ds.

143
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,716
Thanks so much for tuning in, guys. Hopefully you found this video useful.
