1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,886
Ever wondered about the differences between AI, ML, DL and

2
00:00:03,908 --> 00:00:07,594
ds? Well, we're about to explore all of those today. Stay tuned.

3
00:00:07,642 --> 00:00:11,162
So let's dive right into it. So AI versus ML versus

4
00:00:11,226 --> 00:00:14,842
DL versus DS, a whole bunch of jargon, but we're going to clarify

5
00:00:14,986 --> 00:00:18,366
all of that right up. So let's kick things off and take a look at

6
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:22,014
AI. So AI is really to do with

7
00:00:22,052 --> 00:00:26,562
the ability of computers and machines to perform tasks without explicitly

8
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:29,906
programming them, otherwise known as the ability for computers

9
00:00:29,938 --> 00:00:33,234
and machines to think by themselves. So we typically

10
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:37,282
break out AI into two key categories. These are general AI

11
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:41,202
and narrow AI. General AI typically refers to the ability

12
00:00:41,266 --> 00:00:44,874
for a computer or a machine to be able to handle a wide variety of

13
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:48,246
tasks. Us as humans have the ability to do a whole heap

14
00:00:48,278 --> 00:00:51,610
of stuff. We can see, we can speak, we can hear, we can read,

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,642
we can drive, we can do a whole range of things. The ability for AI

16
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:59,434
and machines to be able to do a broad range of tasks similar to humans

17
00:00:59,482 --> 00:01:02,826
is what we typically refer to as general AI.

18
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:06,474
Now, we're still a little bit of a while away from true general AI,

19
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:09,298
but that's not to say it's not to come. Now,

20
00:01:09,384 --> 00:01:13,266
narrow AI, on the other hand, is the ability for a machine to handle a

21
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:17,266
really simple or a really narrow range of tasks. So that could possibly be the

22
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:21,174
ability to translate speech to text, or to classify images as having

23
00:01:21,212 --> 00:01:24,982
different categories, or the ability to predict house prices, for example.

24
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:28,486
All of these are examples of narrow AI. So I'm going

25
00:01:28,508 --> 00:01:31,626
to be painting a bunch of visual imagery to help you remember some of these

26
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,966
topics. So the first one, in terms of breaking out general and narrow

27
00:01:34,998 --> 00:01:38,054
AI, or the ability to remember general and narrow AI,

28
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:41,834
is just picture a really narrow or really skinny general in your mind.

29
00:01:41,872 --> 00:01:46,010
So that way you know that there's two different types of AI, general and narrow.

30
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,454
Now onto the next topic, machine learning. So we've taken a look at AI as

31
00:01:49,492 --> 00:01:53,294
being broken up into general and narrow. But how does machine learning fit into this?

32
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:56,734
Well, machine learning is the application of narrow AI

33
00:01:56,782 --> 00:02:00,402
to specific tasks. Now, when we typically talk about machine learning,

34
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:03,886
we often compare it to traditional programming. So in traditional programming,

35
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:08,078
we supply data plus rules or conditional logic, and we get answers.

36
00:02:08,174 --> 00:02:12,322
Now, in machine learning, on the other hand, we provide data plus historical

37
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:16,322
answers to get rules. We can then pass new data to get new answers.

38
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,766
So this is a bit of a change in the paradigm of how computer scientists

39
00:02:19,798 --> 00:02:23,002
and machine learning engineers are building programs these days.

40
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:26,314
So what are some typical machine learning tasks? Well,

41
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,278
we broadly break out machine learning into three key categories.

42
00:02:30,374 --> 00:02:34,266
These are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and semisupervised

43
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:37,134
learning. So let's take a look at supervised learning first. So,

44
00:02:37,172 --> 00:02:40,778
supervised learning can be broadly broken out into two key categories.

45
00:02:40,874 --> 00:02:44,606
These are classification and regression. Classification is all

46
00:02:44,628 --> 00:02:48,030
to do with grouping things into categories or labels.

47
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,454
So say you had a big data set on all the different types of pizzas

48
00:02:51,502 --> 00:02:54,354
you've liked and whether or not you've liked them. Yes or no,

49
00:02:54,472 --> 00:02:58,190
you could take that data and pass it through to a classification algorithm

50
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,446
to help it learn which types of pizzas you like. So then when you pass

51
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:04,966
through a new list of ingredients, it would be able to predict, yes, you would

52
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:08,198
like that pizza or no, you might not. Regression, on the

53
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:11,834
other hand, is all to do with predicting continuous variables. Some great

54
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:15,366
examples of regression are sales forecasting and predicting prices

55
00:03:15,398 --> 00:03:19,094
of houses. So that encapsulates supervised learning. Now, what about unsupervised

56
00:03:19,142 --> 00:03:22,678
learning? Well, there's two key things to think about when you think

57
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:26,654
of unsupervised learning. These are really clustering. So the ability to

58
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:30,826
group people together. So say you wanted to group together high performing and low performing

59
00:03:30,858 --> 00:03:34,270
and medium performing employees, or high value, low value,

60
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,938
medium value customers, or a whole bunch of other different types of data.

61
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:41,854
But really it's all to do with grouping things together. Now, dimensionality reduction,

62
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:45,826
on the other hand, is all to do with condensing the features that

63
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:49,042
you've got within a machine learning model. So a lot of the time you might

64
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:52,438
start out with a huge data set with a lot of columns, and you're not

65
00:03:52,444 --> 00:03:55,638
really sure which of those columns are important for your machine learning model,

66
00:03:55,724 --> 00:03:59,246
dimensionality reduction helps you reduce the number of columns

67
00:03:59,298 --> 00:04:02,730
that you've got so that you can really focus on the important ones.

68
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,374
Now, in order to remember supervised learning and unsupervised

69
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:10,534
learning, I'd suggest you remember this initialism, Christopher Robin

70
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:13,210
caught a duck. So that way you remember classification,

71
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,846
regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction. So that

72
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:20,714
takes care of supervised and unsupervised learning. But what about semi supervised

73
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:23,982
learning? Well, this is where reinforcement learning comes in.

74
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:27,442
Now, reinforcement learning has four key things. These are

75
00:04:27,496 --> 00:04:30,798
an agent, an action, an environment, and a reward.

76
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:34,514
It's similar to how you might choose to condition a dog. A dog

77
00:04:34,552 --> 00:04:38,246
might do something right, and you might reward it with a piece of food.

78
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:42,358
In a similar way, we train reinforcement learning models to act in a

79
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:46,710
correct way in a given environment in order to learn appropriate actions given

80
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,478
that specific environment. Now, the best way to remember,

81
00:04:49,564 --> 00:04:53,482
reinforcement learning techniques is to remember area 51.

82
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:57,126
So that way you remember agent reward environment and actions.

83
00:04:57,238 --> 00:05:00,426
Okay? So that takes care of machine learning. Now we're going to delve a little

84
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:04,046
bit deeper and get into deep learning. So deep learning is a

85
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:07,626
subset of machine learning, and really it's to do with performing machine

86
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:10,746
learning tasks using deep neural networks.

87
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:14,266
Now, deep neural networks are networks that have multiple hidden

88
00:05:14,298 --> 00:05:17,426
layers. So if you've ever seen a diagram that looks sort of

89
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:21,278
like this, this is a representation of a neural network.

90
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:24,834
But specifically in this case, this is a deep neural network because

91
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:28,210
it has multiple hidden layers. Now, the best way to remember

92
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,214
deep learning is to remember that deep learning is just like an onion. It has

93
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:35,794
multiple layers, little bit like Shrek. Now, that sort of covers

94
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:38,830
AI, ML and DL. What about data science?

95
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,710
Well, data science is the practice that sits over AI,

96
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,154
ML and DL. It basically is the art of

97
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:49,978
extracting knowledge, insight and meaning from data. The best way to

98
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:53,994
remember the key components of data science are to look at the crisp DM

99
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:57,322
framework. So the crisp DM framework stands for the cross

100
00:05:57,386 --> 00:06:01,294
industry standard process for data mining. And basically it's a framework to

101
00:06:01,332 --> 00:06:04,518
help you along your way to producing really good data science

102
00:06:04,554 --> 00:06:07,762
projects. Now, there's six key steps in the data

103
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:11,326
science process. These are business understanding. So understanding

104
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:14,798
the business that you're working with and the environment in which they operate.

105
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,166
Two data understanding. So understanding the data that

106
00:06:18,188 --> 00:06:21,282
you've got on hand. So whether or not you've got missing values,

107
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:24,722
visualizing that data and taking a look at some summary statistics,

108
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:28,374
we've then got data preparation. So this is all to do with getting our

109
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:32,118
data ready for modeling. In this step, we might perform some feature engineering

110
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:35,754
and create some new columns. We might fill in some missing values and a whole

111
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:39,594
bunch of other data preparation steps, like, for example, splitting our

112
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:43,094
data into training and testing. Next, we've got my favorite,

113
00:06:43,142 --> 00:06:46,938
which is modeling. This is all to do with training your machine learning algorithms

114
00:06:47,034 --> 00:06:50,766
to perform well on a specific task. Once we've trained our

115
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:53,850
models in that modeling step, we get onto evaluation.

116
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,734
Given that we've trained our model, we want to make sure that it's going to

117
00:06:56,772 --> 00:07:00,670
work well once we deploy it into the real world. This is what the evaluation

118
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,066
step is all about. In this step, we try to check whether or not

119
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:07,310
our model is likely to perform well using specific evaluation

120
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,806
metrics. Now, once we've gone through all of that, the last step is

121
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:14,386
to go and deploy our model. In order to deploy our model, we could release

122
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:17,526
it as a rest API containerize it up or save it as

123
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:20,954
a binary so we can go and use it elsewhere. Now,

124
00:07:20,992 --> 00:07:24,906
a great way to remember Chris DM is to remember Barry drove directly to

125
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:28,822
the medical emergency department. That way you remember business understanding

126
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:32,438
data understanding data preparation, modeling, evaluation,

127
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:35,994
and deployment. Now, I've talked a lot about theory, but where do the python

128
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:39,434
packages that you typically see used fit into this framework?

129
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:43,114
Well, in terms of data science, numpy, pandas, and Matplotlib

130
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:46,738
are probably going to be the most important packages that you see floating around.

131
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:50,626
Numpy and pandas help you traverse and explore your data and

132
00:07:50,648 --> 00:07:54,146
really work with your data in terms of performing manipulations and

133
00:07:54,168 --> 00:07:57,774
data preparation. Matplotlib and Seaborne help you visualize

134
00:07:57,822 --> 00:08:01,062
that data and explore it even further. Now, the most important

135
00:08:01,116 --> 00:08:05,026
library in terms of machine learning is probably scikitlearn. So Scikitlearn's

136
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:08,934
been around for quite some time and gives you a whole bunch of

137
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:12,070
really powerful algorithms and utilities to help use them

138
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,354
to train your machine learning models. Now, deep learning is becoming increasingly

139
00:08:16,402 --> 00:08:20,014
popular, and there's a large number of libraries that can help you perform

140
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:23,482
deep learning. Some of which are notable are tensorflow,

141
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:27,454
Keras, Pytorch, and piano, just to name a few. And that

142
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:30,874
about wraps up AI versus ML versus DL vs.

143
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:34,762
Ds. Thanks so much for tuning in, guys. Hopefully you found this video useful.

1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,210
Ever wondered about the differences between AI, ML,

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,910
DL and ds? Well, we're about to explore all of those today.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,162
Stay tuned. So let's dive right into it. So AI versus ML versus

4
00:00:11,226 --> 00:00:14,842
DL versus DS, a whole bunch of jargon, but we're going to clarify

5
00:00:14,986 --> 00:00:18,366
all of that right up. So let's kick things off and take a look at

6
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:21,646
AI. So AI is really to

7
00:00:21,668 --> 00:00:25,314
do with the ability of computers and machines to perform tasks

8
00:00:25,362 --> 00:00:28,886
without explicitly programming them, otherwise known as the

9
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:32,886
ability for computers and machines to think by themselves. So we

10
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:36,822
typically break out AI into two key categories. These are general

11
00:00:36,876 --> 00:00:40,646
AI and narrow AI. General AI typically refers to

12
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:44,134
the ability for a computer or a machine to be able to handle a wide

13
00:00:44,182 --> 00:00:47,626
variety of tasks. Us as humans have the ability to do

14
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:50,922
a whole heap of stuff. We can see, we can speak, we can hear,

15
00:00:50,976 --> 00:00:54,142
we can read, we can drive, we can do a whole range of things.

16
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:57,898
The ability for AI and machines to be able to do a broad range

17
00:00:57,914 --> 00:01:02,158
of tasks similar to humans is what we typically refer to as general

18
00:01:02,244 --> 00:01:05,550
AI. Now, we're still a little bit of a while away from true

19
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,658
general AI, but that's not to say it's not to come.

20
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:12,494
Now, narrow AI, on the other hand, is the ability for a machine

21
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:15,934
to handle a really simple or a really narrow range of tasks.

22
00:01:15,982 --> 00:01:19,206
So that could possibly be the ability to translate speech to text,

23
00:01:19,308 --> 00:01:22,962
or to classify images as having different categories, or the ability

24
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:26,514
to predict house prices, for example. All of these are examples

25
00:01:26,562 --> 00:01:29,686
of narrow AI. So I'm going to be painting a bunch of

26
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:32,938
visual imagery to help you remember some of these topics. So the first one,

27
00:01:33,024 --> 00:01:36,266
in terms of breaking out general and narrow AI, or the ability to

28
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:40,134
remember general and narrow AI, is just picture a really narrow

29
00:01:40,182 --> 00:01:43,434
or really skinny general in your mind. So that way you know that there's two

30
00:01:43,472 --> 00:01:47,322
different types of AI, general and narrow. Now onto the next topic,

31
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:50,574
machine learning. So we've taken a look at AI as being broken up into general

32
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:53,886
and narrow. But how does machine learning fit into this? Well,

33
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:58,254
machine learning is the application of narrow AI to specific tasks.

34
00:01:58,382 --> 00:02:01,870
Now, when we typically talk about machine learning, we often compare it to traditional

35
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,886
programming. So in traditional programming, we supply data plus rules

36
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:09,054
or conditional logic, and we get answers. Now, in machine

37
00:02:09,102 --> 00:02:12,322
learning, on the other hand, we provide data plus historical

38
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:15,734
answers to get rules. We can then pass new data to get new

39
00:02:15,772 --> 00:02:19,242
answers. So this is a bit of a change in the paradigm of how computer

40
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:23,002
scientists and machine learning engineers are building programs these days.

41
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:27,094
So what are some typical machine learning tasks? Well, we broadly

42
00:02:27,142 --> 00:02:30,278
break out machine learning into three key categories.

43
00:02:30,374 --> 00:02:34,266
These are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and semisupervised

44
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:38,206
learning. So let's take a look at supervised learning first. So, supervised learning can be

45
00:02:38,228 --> 00:02:41,374
broadly broken out into two key categories. These are

46
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:45,438
classification and regression. Classification is all to do with

47
00:02:45,524 --> 00:02:48,786
grouping things into categories or labels. So say you had

48
00:02:48,808 --> 00:02:51,966
a big data set on all the different types of pizzas you've liked

49
00:02:51,998 --> 00:02:55,106
and whether or not you've liked them. Yes or no, you could take

50
00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:58,190
that data and pass it through to a classification algorithm

51
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,446
to help it learn which types of pizzas you like. So then when you pass

52
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:04,966
through a new list of ingredients, it would be able to predict, yes, you would

53
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:08,374
like that pizza or no, you might not. Regression, on the other

54
00:03:08,412 --> 00:03:12,246
hand, is all to do with predicting continuous variables. Some great examples

55
00:03:12,278 --> 00:03:15,894
of regression are sales forecasting and predicting prices of houses.

56
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:19,094
So that encapsulates supervised learning. Now, what about unsupervised

57
00:03:19,142 --> 00:03:22,942
learning? Well, there's two key things to think about when you think of

58
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:26,394
unsupervised learning. These are really clustering. So the ability

59
00:03:26,442 --> 00:03:30,126
to group people together. So say you wanted to group together high performing and

60
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:33,742
low performing and medium performing employees, or high value,

61
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,554
low value, medium value customers, or a whole bunch of other different types of

62
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,338
data. But really it's all to do with grouping things together.

63
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:44,910
Now, dimensionality reduction, on the other hand, is all to do with condensing

64
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,386
the features that you've got within a machine learning model. So a lot of the

65
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:51,874
time you might start out with a huge data set with a lot of columns,

66
00:03:51,922 --> 00:03:55,254
and you're not really sure which of those columns are important for your machine learning

67
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:58,534
model, dimensionality reduction helps you reduce the number

68
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:02,058
of columns that you've got so that you can really focus on the important

69
00:04:02,144 --> 00:04:05,674
ones. Now, in order to remember supervised learning and

70
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:09,510
unsupervised learning, I'd suggest you remember this initialism,

71
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,210
Christopher Robin caught a duck. So that way you remember classification,

72
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,846
regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction. So that

73
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:20,186
takes care of supervised and unsupervised learning. But what about semi

74
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,694
supervised learning? Well, this is where reinforcement learning comes

75
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:27,442
in. Now, reinforcement learning has four key things. These are

76
00:04:27,496 --> 00:04:30,798
an agent, an action, an environment, and a reward.

77
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:34,514
It's similar to how you might choose to condition a dog. A dog

78
00:04:34,552 --> 00:04:38,246
might do something right, and you might reward it with a piece of food.

79
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:42,022
In a similar way, we train reinforcement learning models to act

80
00:04:42,076 --> 00:04:45,794
in a correct way in a given environment in order to learn appropriate

81
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:48,966
actions given that specific environment. Now, the best way

82
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:52,778
to remember, reinforcement learning techniques is to remember area

83
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:56,214
51. So that way you remember agent reward environment

84
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,818
and actions. Okay? So that takes care of machine learning. Now we're going

85
00:04:59,824 --> 00:05:03,306
to delve a little bit deeper and get into deep learning. So deep

86
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:07,274
learning is a subset of machine learning, and really it's to do with performing

87
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:10,746
machine learning tasks using deep neural networks.

88
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:14,682
Now, deep neural networks are networks that have multiple hidden layers.

89
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:18,066
So if you've ever seen a diagram that looks sort of like this,

90
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:21,278
this is a representation of a neural network.

91
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:24,834
But specifically in this case, this is a deep neural network because

92
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:28,538
it has multiple hidden layers. Now, the best way to remember deep

93
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:31,762
learning is to remember that deep learning is just like an onion.

94
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:35,286
It has multiple layers, little bit like Shrek. Now, that sort

95
00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:38,830
of covers AI, ML and DL. What about data science?

96
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,710
Well, data science is the practice that sits over AI,

97
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,850
ML and DL. It basically is the art

98
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,258
of extracting knowledge, insight and meaning from data.

99
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:52,874
The best way to remember the key components of data science are to look at

100
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:56,798
the crisp DM framework. So the crisp DM framework stands for

101
00:05:56,804 --> 00:06:00,426
the cross industry standard process for data mining. And basically it's

102
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:04,142
a framework to help you along your way to producing really good data

103
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:07,762
science projects. Now, there's six key steps in the data

104
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:11,326
science process. These are business understanding. So understanding

105
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:14,798
the business that you're working with and the environment in which they operate.

106
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,166
Two data understanding. So understanding the data that

107
00:06:18,188 --> 00:06:21,282
you've got on hand. So whether or not you've got missing values,

108
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:24,722
visualizing that data and taking a look at some summary statistics,

109
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:28,102
we've then got data preparation. So this is all to do with getting

110
00:06:28,156 --> 00:06:32,118
our data ready for modeling. In this step, we might perform some feature engineering

111
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:35,754
and create some new columns. We might fill in some missing values and a whole

112
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:39,594
bunch of other data preparation steps, like, for example, splitting our

113
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:43,914
data into training and testing. Next, we've got my favorite, which is modeling.

114
00:06:43,962 --> 00:06:47,678
This is all to do with training your machine learning algorithms to perform

115
00:06:47,764 --> 00:06:51,198
well on a specific task. Once we've trained our models in

116
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:54,938
that modeling step, we get onto evaluation. Given that we've trained

117
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:57,746
our model, we want to make sure that it's going to work well once we

118
00:06:57,768 --> 00:07:01,266
deploy it into the real world. This is what the evaluation step is

119
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:04,706
all about. In this step, we try to check whether or not our model is

120
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:07,982
likely to perform well using specific evaluation metrics.

121
00:07:08,046 --> 00:07:11,334
Now, once we've gone through all of that, the last step is to go and

122
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:14,806
deploy our model. In order to deploy our model, we could release it as a

123
00:07:14,828 --> 00:07:18,406
rest API containerize it up or save it as a binary so

124
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:21,914
we can go and use it elsewhere. Now, a great way to remember

125
00:07:21,952 --> 00:07:25,462
Chris DM is to remember Barry drove directly to the medical

126
00:07:25,526 --> 00:07:29,210
emergency department. That way you remember business understanding data

127
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,438
understanding data preparation, modeling, evaluation,

128
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:35,598
and deployment. Now, I've talked a lot about theory, but where do the

129
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:39,434
python packages that you typically see used fit into this framework?

130
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:43,278
Well, in terms of data science, numpy, pandas, and Matplotlib are

131
00:07:43,284 --> 00:07:46,738
probably going to be the most important packages that you see floating around.

132
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:50,882
Numpy and pandas help you traverse and explore your data and really

133
00:07:50,936 --> 00:07:55,246
work with your data in terms of performing manipulations and data preparation.

134
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:59,026
Matplotlib and Seaborne help you visualize that data and explore

135
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:02,886
it even further. Now, the most important library in terms of machine learning is

136
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:06,374
probably scikitlearn. So Scikitlearn's been around for quite some time

137
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:10,274
and gives you a whole bunch of really powerful algorithms

138
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:14,130
and utilities to help use them to train your machine learning models.

139
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,446
Now, deep learning is becoming increasingly popular, and there's a

140
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:20,862
large number of libraries that can help you perform deep learning.

141
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:24,122
Some of which are notable are tensorflow, Keras,

142
00:08:24,186 --> 00:08:27,454
Pytorch, and piano, just to name a few. And that

143
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:30,874
about wraps up AI versus ML versus DL vs.

144
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:34,762
