1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,886
Ever wondered about the differences between AI, ML, DL and

2
00:00:03,908 --> 00:00:07,594
ds? Well, we're about to explore all of those today. Stay tuned.

3
00:00:07,642 --> 00:00:11,642
So let's dive right into it. So AI versus ML versus DL

4
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:14,842
versus DS, a whole bunch of jargon, but we're going to clarify

5
00:00:14,986 --> 00:00:18,174
all of that right up. So let's kick things off and take a look

6
00:00:18,212 --> 00:00:21,646
at AI. So AI is really to

7
00:00:21,668 --> 00:00:24,758
do with the ability of computers and machines to perform

8
00:00:24,884 --> 00:00:27,686
tasks without explicitly programming them,

9
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:31,366
otherwise known as the ability for computers and machines to think by

10
00:00:31,388 --> 00:00:35,538
themselves. So we typically break out AI into two key categories.

11
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:38,578
These are general AI and narrow AI.

12
00:00:38,754 --> 00:00:42,370
General AI typically refers to the ability for a computer or a

13
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,622
machine to be able to handle a wide variety of tasks.

14
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:49,034
Us as humans have the ability to do a whole heap of stuff. We can

15
00:00:49,072 --> 00:00:52,586
see, we can speak, we can hear, we can read, we can drive, we can

16
00:00:52,608 --> 00:00:55,886
do a whole range of things. The ability for AI and

17
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:59,646
machines to be able to do a broad range of tasks similar to humans is

18
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:02,826
what we typically refer to as general AI.

19
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:06,474
Now, we're still a little bit of a while away from true general AI,

20
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:10,222
but that's not to say it's not to come. Now, narrow AI,

21
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:13,938
on the other hand, is the ability for a machine to handle a really simple

22
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:17,266
or a really narrow range of tasks. So that could possibly be the

23
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:20,934
ability to translate speech to text, or to classify images as

24
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:24,306
having different categories, or the ability to predict house prices,

25
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:27,730
for example. All of these are examples of narrow AI.

26
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,142
So I'm going to be painting a bunch of visual imagery to help you remember

27
00:01:31,196 --> 00:01:34,666
some of these topics. So the first one, in terms of breaking out general and

28
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:38,054
narrow AI, or the ability to remember general and narrow AI,

29
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:41,626
is just picture a really narrow or really skinny general in your

30
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:44,770
mind. So that way you know that there's two different types of AI,

31
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,298
general and narrow. Now onto the next topic, machine learning. So we've

32
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:51,566
taken a look at AI as being broken up into general and narrow. But how

33
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:54,782
does machine learning fit into this? Well, machine learning

34
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:58,254
is the application of narrow AI to specific tasks.

35
00:01:58,382 --> 00:02:02,542
Now, when we typically talk about machine learning, we often compare it to traditional programming.

36
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:06,462
So in traditional programming, we supply data plus rules or conditional

37
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:10,182
logic, and we get answers. Now, in machine learning, on the other hand,

38
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:14,166
we provide data plus historical answers to get rules. We can

39
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:17,446
then pass new data to get new answers. So this is a bit of a

40
00:02:17,468 --> 00:02:20,570
change in the paradigm of how computer scientists and machine learning

41
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,422
engineers are building programs these days. So what are some typical

42
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:28,298
machine learning tasks? Well, we broadly break out machine learning

43
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:31,974
into three key categories. These are supervised learning,

44
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:35,486
unsupervised learning, and semisupervised learning. So let's take a look at

45
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:38,666
supervised learning first. So, supervised learning can be broadly

46
00:02:38,698 --> 00:02:42,446
broken out into two key categories. These are classification and

47
00:02:42,468 --> 00:02:45,994
regression. Classification is all to do with grouping

48
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:49,282
things into categories or labels. So say you had a big data

49
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,386
set on all the different types of pizzas you've liked and whether

50
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:55,906
or not you've liked them. Yes or no, you could take that data and

51
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:59,250
pass it through to a classification algorithm to help it learn

52
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,134
which types of pizzas you like. So then when you pass through a new list

53
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:05,974
of ingredients, it would be able to predict, yes, you would like that pizza or

54
00:03:06,012 --> 00:03:09,546
no, you might not. Regression, on the other hand, is all to do with

55
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:13,274
predicting continuous variables. Some great examples of regression are

56
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:17,414
sales forecasting and predicting prices of houses. So that encapsulates supervised

57
00:03:17,462 --> 00:03:20,842
learning. Now, what about unsupervised learning? Well, there's two

58
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:24,222
key things to think about when you think of unsupervised learning.

59
00:03:24,356 --> 00:03:27,502
These are really clustering. So the ability to group people together.

60
00:03:27,556 --> 00:03:31,054
So say you wanted to group together high performing and low performing and

61
00:03:31,092 --> 00:03:34,942
medium performing employees, or high value, low value, medium value

62
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:37,938
customers, or a whole bunch of other different types of data.

63
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:40,674
But really it's all to do with grouping things together. Now,

64
00:03:40,712 --> 00:03:44,910
dimensionality reduction, on the other hand, is all to do with condensing

65
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,258
the features that you've got within a machine learning model. So a lot of

66
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:51,366
the time you might start out with a huge data set with a lot of

67
00:03:51,388 --> 00:03:55,026
columns, and you're not really sure which of those columns are important for your machine

68
00:03:55,058 --> 00:03:58,726
learning model, dimensionality reduction helps you reduce the number of

69
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:02,730
columns that you've got so that you can really focus on the important ones.

70
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,374
Now, in order to remember supervised learning and unsupervised

71
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:09,510
learning, I'd suggest you remember this initialism,

72
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,210
Christopher Robin caught a duck. So that way you remember classification,

73
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,846
regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction. So that

74
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:20,714
takes care of supervised and unsupervised learning. But what about semi supervised

75
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:23,982
learning? Well, this is where reinforcement learning comes in.

76
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:27,442
Now, reinforcement learning has four key things. These are

77
00:04:27,496 --> 00:04:30,798
an agent, an action, an environment, and a reward.

78
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:34,050
It's similar to how you might choose to condition a dog.

79
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,314
A dog might do something right, and you might reward it with a

80
00:04:37,352 --> 00:04:41,314
piece of food. In a similar way, we train reinforcement learning models

81
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:45,142
to act in a correct way in a given environment in order to learn

82
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:48,966
appropriate actions given that specific environment. Now, the best way

83
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:52,778
to remember, reinforcement learning techniques is to remember area

84
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:57,126
51. So that way you remember agent reward environment and actions.

85
00:04:57,238 --> 00:05:00,426
Okay? So that takes care of machine learning. Now we're going to delve a little

86
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:04,046
bit deeper and get into deep learning. So deep learning is a

87
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:07,626
subset of machine learning, and really it's to do with performing machine

88
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:10,746
learning tasks using deep neural networks.

89
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:14,682
Now, deep neural networks are networks that have multiple hidden layers.

90
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:18,546
So if you've ever seen a diagram that looks sort of like this, this is

91
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,278
a representation of a neural network.

92
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:24,834
But specifically in this case, this is a deep neural network because

93
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:27,906
it has multiple hidden layers. Now, the best way to

94
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:31,446
remember deep learning is to remember that deep learning is just like an

95
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:35,286
onion. It has multiple layers, little bit like Shrek. Now, that sort

96
00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:38,830
of covers AI, ML and DL. What about data science?

97
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,710
Well, data science is the practice that sits over AI,

98
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,902
ML and DL. It basically is the art of extracting

99
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:50,634
knowledge, insight and meaning from data. The best way to remember the key

100
00:05:50,672 --> 00:05:53,994
components of data science are to look at the crisp DM

101
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:57,882
framework. So the crisp DM framework stands for the cross industry

102
00:05:57,946 --> 00:06:01,294
standard process for data mining. And basically it's a framework to

103
00:06:01,332 --> 00:06:05,150
help you along your way to producing really good data science projects.

104
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,626
Now, there's six key steps in the data science process.

105
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:12,434
These are business understanding. So understanding the business that you're working

106
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:16,574
with and the environment in which they operate. Two data understanding.

107
00:06:16,622 --> 00:06:20,178
So understanding the data that you've got on hand. So whether or not you've

108
00:06:20,194 --> 00:06:23,794
got missing values, visualizing that data and taking a look at some summary

109
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:27,286
statistics, we've then got data preparation. So this is all

110
00:06:27,308 --> 00:06:30,774
to do with getting our data ready for modeling. In this step, we might

111
00:06:30,812 --> 00:06:33,994
perform some feature engineering and create some new columns. We might fill

112
00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:37,622
in some missing values and a whole bunch of other data preparation

113
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:41,462
steps, like, for example, splitting our data into training and testing.

114
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:45,230
Next, we've got my favorite, which is modeling. This is all to do with training

115
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,766
your machine learning algorithms to perform well on a specific

116
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:52,030
task. Once we've trained our models in that modeling step,

117
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,646
we get onto evaluation. Given that we've trained our model, we want

118
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:58,546
to make sure that it's going to work well once we deploy it into the

119
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:01,826
real world. This is what the evaluation step is all about.

120
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:05,186
In this step, we try to check whether or not our model is likely to

121
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,914
perform well using specific evaluation metrics. Now, once we've gone

122
00:07:08,952 --> 00:07:12,438
through all of that, the last step is to go and deploy our model.

123
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:16,306
In order to deploy our model, we could release it as a rest API containerize

124
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:19,754
it up or save it as a binary so we can go and use it

125
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:22,906
elsewhere. Now, a great way to remember Chris DM is to

126
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:26,678
remember Barry drove directly to the medical emergency department.

127
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:30,250
That way you remember business understanding data understanding data

128
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,350
preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.

129
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,894
Now, I've talked a lot about theory, but where do the python packages that you

130
00:07:36,932 --> 00:07:40,686
typically see used fit into this framework? Well, in terms of

131
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:44,222
data science, numpy, pandas, and Matplotlib are probably going to be the most

132
00:07:44,276 --> 00:07:48,062
important packages that you see floating around. Numpy and pandas

133
00:07:48,126 --> 00:07:51,890
help you traverse and explore your data and really work with your data

134
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,246
in terms of performing manipulations and data preparation.

135
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:59,026
Matplotlib and Seaborne help you visualize that data and explore

136
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:02,630
it even further. Now, the most important library in terms of machine learning

137
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,102
is probably scikitlearn. So Scikitlearn's been around for quite some

138
00:08:06,156 --> 00:08:09,714
time and gives you a whole bunch of really powerful

139
00:08:09,762 --> 00:08:13,186
algorithms and utilities to help use them to train your machine

140
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:16,802
learning models. Now, deep learning is becoming increasingly popular,

141
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:20,014
and there's a large number of libraries that can help you perform

142
00:08:20,092 --> 00:08:23,482
deep learning. Some of which are notable are tensorflow,

143
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:27,454
Keras, Pytorch, and piano, just to name a few. And that

144
00:08:27,492 --> 00:08:30,874
about wraps up AI versus ML versus DL vs.

145
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:34,302
Ds. Thanks so much for tuning in, guys. Hopefully you found this video

146
00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:37,642
useful. If you did, be sure to give it a thumbs up and hit subscribe.

147
00:08:37,706 --> 00:08:38,766
Until next time.

1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,210
Ever wondered about the differences between AI, ML,

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,910
DL and ds? Well, we're about to explore all of those today.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,762
Stay tuned. So let's dive right into it. So AI versus ML

4
00:00:10,826 --> 00:00:14,842
versus DL versus DS, a whole bunch of jargon, but we're going to clarify

5
00:00:14,986 --> 00:00:18,366
all of that right up. So let's kick things off and take a look at

6
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:21,454
AI. So AI is really

7
00:00:21,492 --> 00:00:25,718
to do with the ability of computers and machines to perform tasks without

8
00:00:25,804 --> 00:00:29,414
explicitly programming them, otherwise known as the ability for

9
00:00:29,452 --> 00:00:33,234
computers and machines to think by themselves. So we typically

10
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:36,822
break out AI into two key categories. These are general

11
00:00:36,876 --> 00:00:40,466
AI and narrow AI. General AI typically refers

12
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:43,754
to the ability for a computer or a machine to be able to handle a

13
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:46,986
wide variety of tasks. Us as humans have the

14
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:50,170
ability to do a whole heap of stuff. We can see, we can speak,

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,458
we can hear, we can read, we can drive, we can do a whole range

16
00:00:53,494 --> 00:00:56,798
of things. The ability for AI and machines to be able

17
00:00:56,804 --> 00:01:00,362
to do a broad range of tasks similar to humans is what we typically

18
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:03,694
refer to as general AI. Now, we're still

19
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:07,186
a little bit of a while away from true general AI, but that's not to

20
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:10,222
say it's not to come. Now, narrow AI,

21
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:13,938
on the other hand, is the ability for a machine to handle a really simple

22
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:17,266
or a really narrow range of tasks. So that could possibly be the

23
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:20,934
ability to translate speech to text, or to classify images as

24
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:24,306
having different categories, or the ability to predict house prices,

25
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:27,730
for example. All of these are examples of narrow AI.

26
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,886
So I'm going to be painting a bunch of visual imagery to help you

27
00:01:30,908 --> 00:01:34,442
remember some of these topics. So the first one, in terms of breaking out general

28
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:38,054
and narrow AI, or the ability to remember general and narrow AI,

29
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:41,834
is just picture a really narrow or really skinny general in your mind.

30
00:01:41,872 --> 00:01:45,566
So that way you know that there's two different types of AI, general and

31
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:49,194
narrow. Now onto the next topic, machine learning. So we've taken a look at AI

32
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:52,814
as being broken up into general and narrow. But how does machine learning fit into

33
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:56,334
this? Well, machine learning is the application of narrow

34
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,586
AI to specific tasks. Now, when we typically talk

35
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:03,342
about machine learning, we often compare it to traditional programming. So in traditional

36
00:02:03,406 --> 00:02:06,894
programming, we supply data plus rules or conditional logic,

37
00:02:06,942 --> 00:02:10,182
and we get answers. Now, in machine learning, on the other hand,

38
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:13,826
we provide data plus historical answers to get rules.

39
00:02:13,858 --> 00:02:17,046
We can then pass new data to get new answers. So this is a

40
00:02:17,068 --> 00:02:21,174
bit of a change in the paradigm of how computer scientists and machine learning engineers

41
00:02:21,222 --> 00:02:24,806
are building programs these days. So what are some typical machine

42
00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:28,874
learning tasks? Well, we broadly break out machine learning into

43
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,974
three key categories. These are supervised learning,

44
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:35,486
unsupervised learning, and semisupervised learning. So let's take a look at

45
00:02:35,508 --> 00:02:39,550
supervised learning first. So, supervised learning can be broadly broken out into

46
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,274
two key categories. These are classification and regression.

47
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:46,702
Classification is all to do with grouping things into

48
00:02:46,756 --> 00:02:50,226
categories or labels. So say you had a big data set on all

49
00:02:50,248 --> 00:02:53,394
the different types of pizzas you've liked and whether or not you've liked them.

50
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:56,866
Yes or no, you could take that data and pass it through to a

51
00:02:56,888 --> 00:03:00,694
classification algorithm to help it learn which types of pizzas you like.

52
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:03,606
So then when you pass through a new list of ingredients, it would be able

53
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:07,190
to predict, yes, you would like that pizza or no, you might not.

54
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,302
Regression, on the other hand, is all to do with predicting continuous variables.

55
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:15,366
Some great examples of regression are sales forecasting and predicting prices

56
00:03:15,398 --> 00:03:19,094
of houses. So that encapsulates supervised learning. Now, what about unsupervised

57
00:03:19,142 --> 00:03:22,942
learning? Well, there's two key things to think about when you think of

58
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:26,894
unsupervised learning. These are really clustering. So the ability to group

59
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:31,054
people together. So say you wanted to group together high performing and low performing and

60
00:03:31,092 --> 00:03:34,270
medium performing employees, or high value, low value,

61
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,938
medium value customers, or a whole bunch of other different types of data.

62
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:40,674
But really it's all to do with grouping things together. Now,

63
00:03:40,712 --> 00:03:44,910
dimensionality reduction, on the other hand, is all to do with condensing

64
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,146
the features that you've got within a machine learning model. So a lot

65
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:51,206
of the time you might start out with a huge data set with a lot

66
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:54,566
of columns, and you're not really sure which of those columns are important for

67
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:58,114
your machine learning model, dimensionality reduction helps you reduce

68
00:03:58,162 --> 00:04:01,290
the number of columns that you've got so that you can really focus

69
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,474
on the important ones. Now, in order to remember

70
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:08,458
supervised learning and unsupervised learning, I'd suggest you remember

71
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:11,886
this initialism, Christopher Robin caught a duck. So that way

72
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:15,802
you remember classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality

73
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:19,214
reduction. So that takes care of supervised and unsupervised learning.

74
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:23,034
But what about semi supervised learning? Well, this is where reinforcement

75
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:26,162
learning comes in. Now, reinforcement learning has four key

76
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:29,774
things. These are an agent, an action, an environment,

77
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:33,778
and a reward. It's similar to how you might choose to condition a

78
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:37,314
dog. A dog might do something right, and you might reward it with a

79
00:04:37,352 --> 00:04:41,314
piece of food. In a similar way, we train reinforcement learning models

80
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:44,614
to act in a correct way in a given environment in order

81
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:48,146
to learn appropriate actions given that specific environment.

82
00:04:48,258 --> 00:04:52,138
Now, the best way to remember, reinforcement learning techniques is to remember

83
00:04:52,304 --> 00:04:56,214
area 51. So that way you remember agent reward environment

84
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,946
and actions. Okay? So that takes care of machine learning. Now we're going to

85
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:03,630
delve a little bit deeper and get into deep learning. So deep learning

86
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,274
is a subset of machine learning, and really it's to do with performing

87
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:10,746
machine learning tasks using deep neural networks.

88
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:14,682
Now, deep neural networks are networks that have multiple hidden layers.

89
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:18,066
So if you've ever seen a diagram that looks sort of like this,

90
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:21,278
this is a representation of a neural network.

91
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:24,834
But specifically in this case, this is a deep neural network because

92
00:05:24,872 --> 00:05:28,210
it has multiple hidden layers. Now, the best way to remember

93
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,762
deep learning is to remember that deep learning is just like an onion.

94
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:34,726
It has multiple layers, little bit like Shrek. Now,

95
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:38,262
that sort of covers AI, ML and DL. What about data

96
00:05:38,316 --> 00:05:42,138
science? Well, data science is the practice that sits over

97
00:05:42,224 --> 00:05:45,850
AI, ML and DL. It basically is the art

98
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,258
of extracting knowledge, insight and meaning from data.

99
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:52,874
The best way to remember the key components of data science are to look at

100
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:56,666
the crisp DM framework. So the crisp DM framework stands

101
00:05:56,698 --> 00:06:00,426
for the cross industry standard process for data mining. And basically it's

102
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,822
a framework to help you along your way to producing really good

103
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:07,474
data science projects. Now, there's six key steps in the

104
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:11,326
data science process. These are business understanding. So understanding

105
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:14,798
the business that you're working with and the environment in which they operate.

106
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,386
Two data understanding. So understanding the data that you've

107
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:22,422
got on hand. So whether or not you've got missing values, visualizing that data

108
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:26,530
and taking a look at some summary statistics, we've then got data preparation.

109
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,730
So this is all to do with getting our data ready for modeling.

110
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,334
In this step, we might perform some feature engineering and create some new columns.

111
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:37,622
We might fill in some missing values and a whole bunch of other data preparation

112
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:40,746
steps, like, for example, splitting our data into training and

113
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:44,366
testing. Next, we've got my favorite, which is modeling. This is all

114
00:06:44,388 --> 00:06:47,678
to do with training your machine learning algorithms to perform

115
00:06:47,764 --> 00:06:51,098
well on a specific task. Once we've trained our models

116
00:06:51,114 --> 00:06:54,666
in that modeling step, we get onto evaluation. Given that we've

117
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:57,578
trained our model, we want to make sure that it's going to work well once

118
00:06:57,604 --> 00:07:01,042
we deploy it into the real world. This is what the evaluation step

119
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:04,226
is all about. In this step, we try to check whether or not our

120
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:07,310
model is likely to perform well using specific evaluation

121
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,966
metrics. Now, once we've gone through all of that, the last step is to

122
00:07:10,988 --> 00:07:14,566
go and deploy our model. In order to deploy our model, we could release it

123
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:18,130
as a rest API containerize it up or save it as a binary

124
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,546
so we can go and use it elsewhere. Now, a great way

125
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:24,694
to remember Chris DM is to remember Barry drove directly

126
00:07:24,742 --> 00:07:28,822
to the medical emergency department. That way you remember business understanding

127
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:31,702
data understanding data preparation, modeling,

128
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:35,598
evaluation, and deployment. Now, I've talked a lot about theory, but where do the

129
00:07:35,604 --> 00:07:38,766
python packages that you typically see used fit into this

130
00:07:38,788 --> 00:07:41,834
framework? Well, in terms of data science, numpy,

131
00:07:41,882 --> 00:07:45,714
pandas, and Matplotlib are probably going to be the most important packages that you see

132
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:49,554
floating around. Numpy and pandas help you traverse and

133
00:07:49,592 --> 00:07:53,774
explore your data and really work with your data in terms of performing manipulations

134
00:07:53,902 --> 00:07:57,266
and data preparation. Matplotlib and Seaborne help you

135
00:07:57,288 --> 00:08:00,066
visualize that data and explore it even further.

136
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:04,082
Now, the most important library in terms of machine learning is probably scikitlearn.

137
00:08:04,146 --> 00:08:07,622
So Scikitlearn's been around for quite some time and gives you a

138
00:08:07,676 --> 00:08:11,286
whole bunch of really powerful algorithms and utilities to

139
00:08:11,308 --> 00:08:15,602
help use them to train your machine learning models. Now, deep learning is becoming

140
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,254
increasingly popular, and there's a large number of libraries that can help

141
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:22,734
you perform deep learning. Some of which are notable are

142
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:26,126
tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, and piano, just to

143
00:08:26,148 --> 00:08:29,594
name a few. And that about wraps up AI versus ML

144
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:33,022
versus DL vs. Ds. Thanks so much for tuning in, guys.

145
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:36,238
Hopefully you found this video useful. If you did, be sure to give it a

146
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:38,766
thumbs up and hit subscribe. Until next time.

1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,886
Ever wondered about the differences between AI, ML, DL and

2
00:00:03,908 --> 00:00:07,594
ds? Well, we're about to explore all of those today. Stay tuned.

3
00:00:07,642 --> 00:00:11,162
So let's dive right into it. So AI versus ML versus

4
00:00:11,226 --> 00:00:14,842
DL versus DS, a whole bunch of jargon, but we're going to clarify

5
00:00:14,986 --> 00:00:18,366
all of that right up. So let's kick things off and take a look at

6
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:21,646
AI. So AI is really to

7
00:00:21,668 --> 00:00:25,718
do with the ability of computers and machines to perform tasks without

8
00:00:25,804 --> 00:00:28,886
explicitly programming them, otherwise known as the

9
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:31,960
ability for computers and machines to think by themselves.

10
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:36,374
So we typically break out AI into two key categories. These are

11
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:40,002
general AI and narrow AI. General AI typically

12
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:43,494
refers to the ability for a computer or a machine to be able to handle

13
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:46,646
a wide variety of tasks. Us as humans

14
00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:49,834
have the ability to do a whole heap of stuff. We can see, we can

15
00:00:49,872 --> 00:00:53,082
speak, we can hear, we can read, we can drive, we can do a whole

16
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,362
range of things. The ability for AI and machines

17
00:00:56,426 --> 00:00:59,806
to be able to do a broad range of tasks similar to humans is what

18
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:03,166
we typically refer to as general AI. Now,

19
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,474
we're still a little bit of a while away from true general AI,

20
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:10,222
but that's not to say it's not to come. Now, narrow AI,

21
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:13,938
on the other hand, is the ability for a machine to handle a really simple

22
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:17,266
or a really narrow range of tasks. So that could possibly be the

23
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:20,934
ability to translate speech to text, or to classify images as

24
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:24,306
having different categories, or the ability to predict house prices,

25
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:27,730
for example. All of these are examples of narrow AI.

26
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,142
So I'm going to be painting a bunch of visual imagery to help you remember

27
00:01:31,196 --> 00:01:34,666
some of these topics. So the first one, in terms of breaking out general and

28
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:38,054
narrow AI, or the ability to remember general and narrow AI,

29
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:41,498
is just picture a really narrow or really skinny general in

30
00:01:41,504 --> 00:01:44,770
your mind. So that way you know that there's two different types of AI,

31
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:48,638
general and narrow. Now onto the next topic, machine learning. So we've taken a

32
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:52,026
look at AI as being broken up into general and narrow. But how does machine

33
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:55,586
learning fit into this? Well, machine learning is the application

34
00:01:55,688 --> 00:01:59,342
of narrow AI to specific tasks. Now, when we typically

35
00:01:59,406 --> 00:02:02,946
talk about machine learning, we often compare it to traditional programming. So in

36
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:06,894
traditional programming, we supply data plus rules or conditional logic,

37
00:02:06,942 --> 00:02:11,238
and we get answers. Now, in machine learning, on the other hand, we provide data

38
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:14,854
plus historical answers to get rules. We can then pass new

39
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:17,958
data to get new answers. So this is a bit of a change in the

40
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:21,386
paradigm of how computer scientists and machine learning engineers are

41
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:25,130
building programs these days. So what are some typical machine learning

42
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,298
tasks? Well, we broadly break out machine learning

43
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:31,974
into three key categories. These are supervised learning,

44
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:35,946
unsupervised learning, and semisupervised learning. So let's take a look at supervised

45
00:02:35,978 --> 00:02:39,550
learning first. So, supervised learning can be broadly broken out into

46
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,274
two key categories. These are classification and regression.

47
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:47,242
Classification is all to do with grouping things into categories

48
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:50,878
or labels. So say you had a big data set on all the different types

49
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:54,354
of pizzas you've liked and whether or not you've liked them. Yes or no,

50
00:02:54,472 --> 00:02:58,190
you could take that data and pass it through to a classification algorithm

51
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,446
to help it learn which types of pizzas you like. So then when you pass

52
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:04,550
through a new list of ingredients, it would be able to predict, yes,

53
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,906
you would like that pizza or no, you might not. Regression,

54
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,302
on the other hand, is all to do with predicting continuous variables.

55
00:03:11,366 --> 00:03:14,474
Some great examples of regression are sales forecasting and

56
00:03:14,512 --> 00:03:17,770
predicting prices of houses. So that encapsulates supervised learning.

57
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,706
Now, what about unsupervised learning? Well, there's two key things to

58
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,786
think about when you think of unsupervised learning. These are really clustering.

59
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:29,198
So the ability to group people together. So say you wanted to group together

60
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:32,666
high performing and low performing and medium performing employees,

61
00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:36,446
or high value, low value, medium value customers, or a whole bunch

62
00:03:36,478 --> 00:03:39,694
of other different types of data. But really it's all to do with grouping

63
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:43,138
things together. Now, dimensionality reduction, on the other hand, is all to

64
00:03:43,144 --> 00:03:46,926
do with condensing the features that you've got within a machine

65
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:50,182
learning model. So a lot of the time you might start out with a huge

66
00:03:50,236 --> 00:03:53,366
data set with a lot of columns, and you're not really sure which of those

67
00:03:53,388 --> 00:03:56,962
columns are important for your machine learning model, dimensionality reduction

68
00:03:57,026 --> 00:04:00,922
helps you reduce the number of columns that you've got so that you can really

69
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:05,174
focus on the important ones. Now, in order to remember supervised

70
00:04:05,222 --> 00:04:08,794
learning and unsupervised learning, I'd suggest you remember this

71
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,046
initialism, Christopher Robin caught a duck. So that way you

72
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:15,802
remember classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality

73
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:19,214
reduction. So that takes care of supervised and unsupervised learning.

74
00:04:19,252 --> 00:04:23,034
But what about semi supervised learning? Well, this is where reinforcement

75
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:26,674
learning comes in. Now, reinforcement learning has four key things.

76
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:30,226
These are an agent, an action, an environment, and a

77
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:33,778
reward. It's similar to how you might choose to condition a

78
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:37,614
dog. A dog might do something right, and you might reward it with a piece

79
00:04:37,672 --> 00:04:41,314
of food. In a similar way, we train reinforcement learning models

80
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:44,854
to act in a correct way in a given environment in order to

81
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:48,146
learn appropriate actions given that specific environment.

82
00:04:48,258 --> 00:04:52,138
Now, the best way to remember, reinforcement learning techniques is to remember

83
00:04:52,304 --> 00:04:55,590
area 51. So that way you remember agent reward

84
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,046
environment and actions. Okay? So that takes care of machine

85
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:02,558
learning. Now we're going to delve a little bit deeper and get into deep learning.

86
00:05:02,724 --> 00:05:06,026
So deep learning is a subset of machine learning, and really it's

87
00:05:06,058 --> 00:05:09,514
to do with performing machine learning tasks using deep

88
00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:13,374
neural networks. Now, deep neural networks are networks that have

89
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:16,866
multiple hidden layers. So if you've ever seen a diagram that

90
00:05:16,888 --> 00:05:20,274
looks sort of like this, this is a representation of a

91
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:23,538
neural network. But specifically in this case, this is a

92
00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:27,266
deep neural network because it has multiple hidden layers. Now,

93
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:31,014
the best way to remember deep learning is to remember that deep learning is just

94
00:05:31,052 --> 00:05:34,210
like an onion. It has multiple layers, little bit like Shrek.

95
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,974
Now, that sort of covers AI, ML and DL. What about

96
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:41,734
data science? Well, data science is the practice that sits

97
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:45,514
over AI, ML and DL. It basically is the

98
00:05:45,552 --> 00:05:49,258
art of extracting knowledge, insight and meaning from data.

99
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:52,874
The best way to remember the key components of data science are to look at

100
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:56,666
the crisp DM framework. So the crisp DM framework stands

101
00:05:56,698 --> 00:06:00,606
for the cross industry standard process for data mining. And basically it's a

102
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:04,142
framework to help you along your way to producing really good data

103
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:07,762
science projects. Now, there's six key steps in the data

104
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:11,326
science process. These are business understanding. So understanding

105
00:06:11,358 --> 00:06:14,798
the business that you're working with and the environment in which they operate.

106
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,386
Two data understanding. So understanding the data that you've

107
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:22,166
got on hand. So whether or not you've got missing values, visualizing that

108
00:06:22,188 --> 00:06:25,366
data and taking a look at some summary statistics, we've then

109
00:06:25,388 --> 00:06:28,662
got data preparation. So this is all to do with getting our data

110
00:06:28,716 --> 00:06:32,118
ready for modeling. In this step, we might perform some feature engineering

111
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:35,754
and create some new columns. We might fill in some missing values and a whole

112
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:39,594
bunch of other data preparation steps, like, for example, splitting our

113
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,714
data into training and testing. Next, we've got my

114
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:46,938
favorite, which is modeling. This is all to do with training your machine learning algorithms

115
00:06:47,034 --> 00:06:49,642
to perform well on a specific task.

116
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:53,850
Once we've trained our models in that modeling step, we get onto evaluation.

117
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,734
Given that we've trained our model, we want to make sure that it's going to

118
00:06:56,772 --> 00:07:00,114
work well once we deploy it into the real world. This is what the

119
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:03,266
evaluation step is all about. In this step, we try to

120
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:07,310
check whether or not our model is likely to perform well using specific evaluation

121
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,806
metrics. Now, once we've gone through all of that, the last step is

122
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:14,386
to go and deploy our model. In order to deploy our model, we could release

123
00:07:14,418 --> 00:07:18,130
it as a rest API containerize it up or save it as a binary

124
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,914
so we can go and use it elsewhere. Now, a great way to remember

125
00:07:21,952 --> 00:07:26,022
Chris DM is to remember Barry drove directly to the medical emergency

126
00:07:26,086 --> 00:07:29,210
department. That way you remember business understanding data

127
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,438
understanding data preparation, modeling, evaluation,

128
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:36,442
and deployment. Now, I've talked a lot about theory, but where do the python packages

129
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:40,046
that you typically see used fit into this framework? Well,

130
00:07:40,148 --> 00:07:43,678
in terms of data science, numpy, pandas, and Matplotlib are probably going to

131
00:07:43,684 --> 00:07:46,738
be the most important packages that you see floating around.

132
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:50,114
Numpy and pandas help you traverse and explore your

133
00:07:50,152 --> 00:07:53,774
data and really work with your data in terms of performing manipulations

134
00:07:53,902 --> 00:07:57,774
and data preparation. Matplotlib and Seaborne help you visualize

135
00:07:57,822 --> 00:08:01,062
that data and explore it even further. Now, the most important

136
00:08:01,116 --> 00:08:05,026
library in terms of machine learning is probably scikitlearn. So Scikitlearn's

137
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:08,934
been around for quite some time and gives you a whole bunch of

138
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:12,326
really powerful algorithms and utilities to help use them to

139
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:15,602
train your machine learning models. Now, deep learning is becoming

140
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,014
increasingly popular, and there's a large number of libraries that can

141
00:08:19,052 --> 00:08:22,442
help you perform deep learning. Some of which are notable

142
00:08:22,506 --> 00:08:25,642
are tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch, and piano,

143
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:29,994
just to name a few. And that about wraps up AI versus ML versus

144
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:33,022
DL vs. Ds. Thanks so much for tuning in, guys.

145
00:08:33,076 --> 00:08:36,238
Hopefully you found this video useful. If you did, be sure to give it a

146
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:38,766
thumbs up and hit subscribe. Until next time.

1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,458
Ever wondered about the differences between AI, ML, DL and ds?

2
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:08,106
Well, we're about to explore all of those today. Stay tuned. So let's

3
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:11,994
dive right into it. So AI versus ML versus DL versus

4
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:15,486
DS, a whole bunch of jargon, but we're going to clarify all of

5
00:00:15,508 --> 00:00:19,150
that right up. So let's kick things off and take a look at AI.

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,418
So AI is really to do with the ability of computers

7
00:00:23,434 --> 00:00:27,686
and machines to perform tasks without explicitly programming them,

8
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:30,886
otherwise known as the ability for computers and machines to

9
00:00:30,908 --> 00:00:34,454
think by themselves. So we typically break out AI into

10
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:38,578
two key categories. These are general AI and narrow AI.

11
00:00:38,754 --> 00:00:41,990
General AI typically refers to the ability for a computer

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,622
or a machine to be able to handle a wide variety of tasks.

13
00:00:45,766 --> 00:00:49,034
Us as humans have the ability to do a whole heap of stuff. We can

14
00:00:49,072 --> 00:00:52,282
see, we can speak, we can hear, we can read, we can drive,

15
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:56,362
we can do a whole range of things. The ability for AI and machines

16
00:00:56,426 --> 00:00:59,806
to be able to do a broad range of tasks similar to humans is what

17
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:02,826
we typically refer to as general AI.

18
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:06,474
Now, we're still a little bit of a while away from true general AI,

19
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:10,222
but that's not to say it's not to come. Now, narrow AI,

20
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:13,938
on the other hand, is the ability for a machine to handle a really simple

21
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:17,498
or a really narrow range of tasks. So that could possibly be the ability

22
00:01:17,534 --> 00:01:21,174
to translate speech to text, or to classify images as having

23
00:01:21,212 --> 00:01:24,982
different categories, or the ability to predict house prices, for example.

24
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:28,726
All of these are examples of narrow AI. So I'm going to be

25
00:01:28,748 --> 00:01:32,006
painting a bunch of visual imagery to help you remember some of these topics.

26
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:35,382
So the first one, in terms of breaking out general and narrow AI,

27
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:39,386
or the ability to remember general and narrow AI, is just picture a

28
00:01:39,408 --> 00:01:42,874
really narrow or really skinny general in your mind. So that way you know that

29
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:46,010
there's two different types of AI, general and narrow.

30
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,454
Now onto the next topic, machine learning. So we've taken a look at AI as

31
00:01:49,492 --> 00:01:52,814
being broken up into general and narrow. But how does machine learning fit into

32
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:56,334
this? Well, machine learning is the application of narrow

33
00:01:56,382 --> 00:02:00,402
AI to specific tasks. Now, when we typically talk about machine learning,

34
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:03,886
we often compare it to traditional programming. So in traditional programming,

35
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:06,894
we supply data plus rules or conditional logic,

36
00:02:06,942 --> 00:02:10,182
and we get answers. Now, in machine learning, on the other hand,

37
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:14,166
we provide data plus historical answers to get rules. We can

38
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:17,446
then pass new data to get new answers. So this is a bit of a

39
00:02:17,468 --> 00:02:21,386
change in the paradigm of how computer scientists and machine learning engineers are

40
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:25,782
building programs these days. So what are some typical machine learning tasks?

41
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:29,674
Well, we broadly break out machine learning into three key

42
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:31,974
categories. These are supervised learning,

43
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:36,270
unsupervised learning, and semisupervised learning. So let's take a look at supervised learning

44
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,854
first. So, supervised learning can be broadly broken out into two

45
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:43,274
key categories. These are classification and regression.

46
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:47,242
Classification is all to do with grouping things into categories

47
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:50,878
or labels. So say you had a big data set on all the different types

48
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:54,354
of pizzas you've liked and whether or not you've liked them. Yes or no,

49
00:02:54,472 --> 00:02:58,190
you could take that data and pass it through to a classification algorithm

50
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,446
to help it learn which types of pizzas you like. So then when you pass

51
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:04,966
through a new list of ingredients, it would be able to predict, yes, you would

52
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:08,662
like that pizza or no, you might not. Regression, on the other hand,

53
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:12,246
is all to do with predicting continuous variables. Some great examples

54
00:03:12,278 --> 00:03:15,894
of regression are sales forecasting and predicting prices of houses.

55
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:19,642
So that encapsulates supervised learning. Now, what about unsupervised learning?

56
00:03:19,776 --> 00:03:23,674
Well, there's two key things to think about when you think of unsupervised

57
00:03:23,722 --> 00:03:26,894
learning. These are really clustering. So the ability to group

58
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:30,826
people together. So say you wanted to group together high performing and low performing

59
00:03:30,858 --> 00:03:34,270
and medium performing employees, or high value, low value,

60
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,938
medium value customers, or a whole bunch of other different types of data.

61
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:41,854
But really it's all to do with grouping things together. Now, dimensionality reduction,

62
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:45,234
on the other hand, is all to do with condensing the

63
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:48,594
features that you've got within a machine learning model. So a lot of the time

64
00:03:48,632 --> 00:03:51,874
you might start out with a huge data set with a lot of columns,

65
00:03:51,922 --> 00:03:55,254
and you're not really sure which of those columns are important for your machine learning

66
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:59,246
model, dimensionality reduction helps you reduce the number of columns

67
00:03:59,298 --> 00:04:02,730
that you've got so that you can really focus on the important ones.

68
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,018
Now, in order to remember supervised learning and unsupervised learning,

69
00:04:07,184 --> 00:04:10,806
I'd suggest you remember this initialism, Christopher Robin caught

70
00:04:10,838 --> 00:04:14,090
a duck. So that way you remember classification, regression,

71
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,534
clustering and dimensionality reduction. So that takes care of

72
00:04:17,572 --> 00:04:21,070
supervised and unsupervised learning. But what about semi supervised learning?

73
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,254
Well, this is where reinforcement learning comes in. Now,

74
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:27,714
reinforcement learning has four key things. These are an

75
00:04:27,752 --> 00:04:31,746
agent, an action, an environment, and a reward. It's similar to

76
00:04:31,768 --> 00:04:35,522
how you might choose to condition a dog. A dog might do something right,

77
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:39,030
and you might reward it with a piece of food. In a similar

78
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,630
way, we train reinforcement learning models to act in a correct

79
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,290
way in a given environment in order to learn appropriate actions

80
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,478
given that specific environment. Now, the best way to remember,

81
00:04:49,564 --> 00:04:53,482
reinforcement learning techniques is to remember area 51.

82
00:04:53,536 --> 00:04:57,126
So that way you remember agent reward environment and actions.

83
00:04:57,238 --> 00:05:00,426
Okay? So that takes care of machine learning. Now we're going to delve a little

84
00:05:00,448 --> 00:05:04,426
bit deeper and get into deep learning. So deep learning is a subset

85
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,950
of machine learning, and really it's to do with performing machine learning

86
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,746
tasks using deep neural networks.

87
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:14,682
Now, deep neural networks are networks that have multiple hidden layers.

88
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:18,066
So if you've ever seen a diagram that looks sort of like this,

89
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:21,278
this is a representation of a neural network.

90
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:24,542
But specifically in this case, this is a deep neural network

91
00:05:24,606 --> 00:05:28,210
because it has multiple hidden layers. Now, the best way to remember

92
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,214
deep learning is to remember that deep learning is just like an onion. It has

93
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:35,398
multiple layers, little bit like Shrek. Now, that sort of

94
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:38,830
covers AI, ML and DL. What about data science?

95
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,710
Well, data science is the practice that sits over AI,

96
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,902
ML and DL. It basically is the art of extracting

97
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:50,426
knowledge, insight and meaning from data. The best way to remember the

98
00:05:50,448 --> 00:05:54,634
key components of data science are to look at the crisp DM framework.

99
00:05:54,762 --> 00:05:58,750
So the crisp DM framework stands for the cross industry standard process

100
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,094
for data mining. And basically it's a framework to help you along

101
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:05,522
your way to producing really good data science projects. Now,

102
00:06:05,576 --> 00:06:08,626
there's six key steps in the data science process.

103
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:12,066
These are business understanding. So understanding the business that

104
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:14,798
you're working with and the environment in which they operate.

105
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:18,710
Two data understanding. So understanding the data that you've got

106
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,422
on hand. So whether or not you've got missing values, visualizing that data

107
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:26,530
and taking a look at some summary statistics, we've then got data preparation.

108
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,166
So this is all to do with getting our data ready for modeling. In this

109
00:06:30,188 --> 00:06:33,754
step, we might perform some feature engineering and create some new columns. We might

110
00:06:33,792 --> 00:06:37,622
fill in some missing values and a whole bunch of other data preparation

111
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:41,462
steps, like, for example, splitting our data into training and testing.

112
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:44,894
Next, we've got my favorite, which is modeling. This is all to do with

113
00:06:44,932 --> 00:06:48,766
training your machine learning algorithms to perform well on a specific

114
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:52,030
task. Once we've trained our models in that modeling step,

115
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,294
we get onto evaluation. Given that we've trained our model,

116
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:58,226
we want to make sure that it's going to work well once we deploy it

117
00:06:58,248 --> 00:07:01,826
into the real world. This is what the evaluation step is all about.

118
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:05,186
In this step, we try to check whether or not our model is likely to

119
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,686
perform well using specific evaluation metrics. Now, once we've

120
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:12,438
gone through all of that, the last step is to go and deploy our model.

121
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:16,306
In order to deploy our model, we could release it as a rest API containerize

122
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:19,754
it up or save it as a binary so we can go and use it

123
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:23,306
elsewhere. Now, a great way to remember Chris DM is to remember

124
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:27,146
Barry drove directly to the medical emergency department. That way

125
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:30,250
you remember business understanding data understanding data

126
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,094
preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment. Now, I've talked

127
00:07:34,132 --> 00:07:37,950
a lot about theory, but where do the python packages that you typically see used

128
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,274
fit into this framework? Well, in terms of data science,

129
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:44,650
numpy, pandas, and Matplotlib are probably going to be the most important

130
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,738
packages that you see floating around. Numpy and pandas help you

131
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:52,098
traverse and explore your data and really work with your data in

132
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:55,246
terms of performing manipulations and data preparation.

133
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:59,026
Matplotlib and Seaborne help you visualize that data and explore

134
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:02,630
it even further. Now, the most important library in terms of machine learning

135
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,102
is probably scikitlearn. So Scikitlearn's been around for quite some

136
00:08:06,156 --> 00:08:09,714
time and gives you a whole bunch of really powerful

137
00:08:09,762 --> 00:08:13,186
algorithms and utilities to help use them to train your machine

138
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:16,802
learning models. Now, deep learning is becoming increasingly popular,

139
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:20,346
and there's a large number of libraries that can help you perform deep

140
00:08:20,378 --> 00:08:23,482
learning. Some of which are notable are tensorflow,

141
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:26,926
Keras, Pytorch, and piano, just to name a few.

142
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:30,874
And that about wraps up AI versus ML versus DL vs.

143
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:34,302
Ds. Thanks so much for tuning in, guys. Hopefully you found this video
